Hello, I am having trouble with my autograder `grade.sh` script for Lab 6. I have designed it to display the number of tests that are passing in my program and everything seems to work except the score part, where it keeps saying `Total Score Is: 0 out of 1`. I've looked over the bash script and I can't find any reason as to why it keeps displaying zero, but there must be some issue. The autograder must be broken!!! 

Here is an image of my autograder:
